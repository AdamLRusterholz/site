<h1>Why Get A Custom Desktop Computer?</h1>
<p class="eighty">With computers being so integral to many people's work and home lives, it makes sense to have a machine that is suited to the personal needs and preferences of the user. That's not possible with computers bought off the shelf, as the companies selling computers want to make them as cheaply as possible and sell them to as many people as possible. Building a custom computer ensures that only quality parts have been used and that those parts are the most suitable for what you do. </p>

<p class="eighty"> Buying individual components is much more cost effective than completed systems, so you will get a more powerful system for a similar amount of money. As well, most componenets come with 2 or 3 year warranties, while most systems will come with one year. This keeps custom PCs protected under warranty for longer than systems from companies like Dell or HP, with the minor inconvience of finding the faulty component.</p>

<p class="eighty"> In general, you'll have much more control over your PC, including in easily repairing it or upgrading it whenever you choose, at the cost of having to learn a bit more about computers (which may not be a cost at all). If a custom PC sounds right for you, there are multiple options.</p>

<h2>How do I get one?</h2>
<p class="eighty"> I recommend everyone who wants a custom computer to build it themselves. You can buy off the shelf components from stores like bestbuy, microcenter, or amazon, and build a computer all on your own. This will save you money and give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of computers. Information on the Hardware and Assembly pages will help you learn about this process.</p>
 <p class="eighty">If building a custom PC isn't something you want to do, but having one is, then I offer my services as an experienced systems integrator. We will go over what you want in a custom PC and work together to find parts that work for you, then I'll assemble it and ship it to you for a reasonable price, along with providing first time setup support. Head over to the Contact page to learn more about this service.</p>
