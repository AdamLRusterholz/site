<h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
<p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It's where most of the actual work happens. The faster the processor, the faster the computer. In addition, a processor with more Cores will be able to handle more work at one time, increasing it's speed when performing multiple tasks. Processors generate tons of heat so they need to be kept cool, and better processors generally require better cooling solutions. </p>

<h2>Motherboard</h2>
<p>The Motherboard is the nervous system and skeleton of a computer. It holds the pieces together in one place, and allows them to talk to each other through metal traces. In the middle is the CPU socket, which will support either Intel or AMD CPUs. Make sure to buy a Motherboard and CPU that are compatible. The rest of the motherboard is covered in slots for components and connectors for cables. It also acts as the interface between the computer and other devices, like the monitor and keyboard, through the Input/Output ports on the back edge.   </p>

<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
<p>	RAM is a computers Main Memory. It temporarily stores information for the CPU to use. When you run a program, as much as possible gets loaded from the slow Secondary Memory into RAM so the CPU will have access to the data it needs quickly. More intensive programs require more memory. Programs start to slow down when you don't have enough, and some complex ones won't run at all. Most will want at least 8gb of RAM to work comfortably, especially since most users are multitasking. People playing games or editing video will want even more. </p>

<img src="https://website-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/power.png" alt="Power Supply" width="700" height="468"><br>
<h2>Power Supply</h2>
<p>The Power Supply provides proper voltage to the different parts of the computer. It connects to the motherboard in multiple places, and must also be connected directly to some components, like Graphics Cards. You must have a power supply that can handle the load of all of your components at once. Wattage ratings are available for most components so that you can roughly calculate the max load of your PC. It's best to overshoot your wattage requirements by a good margin, such as a 650w power supply for a PC that has a 400w max load. It's also best to only buy power supplies that have an 80 Plus efficiency certification.  </p>

<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs—Left) and Solid State Drives (SSDs—Right) are the two types of Secondary Storage for PCs. HDDs are slower, but they are much cheaper and can be made much larger than SSDs. SSDs become quite expensive, especially those bigger than 500gb, but their incredible speed makes a noticeable difference in use. The most common way to utilize the benefits of both is to install the operating system and a few essential programs on a smaller SSD, then have a very large HDD as a secondary drive to store large programs and files. The operating system will feel quick and responsive thanks to the SSD, and you'll have plenty of storage space thanks to the HDD.    </p>

<h2>Graphics Card</h2>
<p>Graphics cards are made of a powerful Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a special type of RAM, called VRAM. They allow the computer to do much more intensive graphics work than the central processor could on its own. They are necessary for a smooth gaming experience and when working with high resolution images or videos. They are also useful for more niche applications, like machine learning and cryptocurrency mining. This is often the most expensive component in a high end computer. </p>

<h2>Case</h2>
<p>Cases vary wildly in style and size. They are standardized by the sizes of motherboards they support. From largest to smallest it goes ATX, microATX, mini-ITX. The larger sizes will fit smaller motherboards, but not vice versa. This is an area where performance hardly matters, so get a case that you like to look at. mATX is my recommendation for size, as ATX is often very big and ITX can be too small for larger components.    </p>
