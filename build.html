<h1>Building a Computer</h1>
<p>Building a PC isn't as hard as most people would expect, but there are a few things you have to know. The video guide below will walk you through the entire process of building a custom Personal Computer, including how to choose the parts to buy for your unique computer needs. This guide is adjustable to any price range, and also helps you decide on the price range that's best for you if you aren't sure. </p>
